# Portfolio-Richard-Murphy

I am creating a portfolio where I can showcase new skills as they are acquired, so I can demonstrate why I will be a valuable asset to a potential employer. I will be updating this portfolio as I have content to add that highlights skills that I've used on projects. The portfolio is using HTML and CSS for the time being.
