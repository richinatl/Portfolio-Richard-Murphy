# Portfolio-Richard-Murphy

This is my personal portfolio site, telling a little of my story, showing some of my projects that I've worked on, visit for a while and see if I may be able to help you with your software development needs. Every day I continue to add skills, right now I am working on adding Java, Spring, and Angular to the list of technologies I am familiar with, in this industry the learning never ends. And that might be my favorite thing about it, there's always a new challenge coming
